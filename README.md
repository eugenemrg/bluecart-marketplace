# BlueCart Marketplace Store
One of the major issues facing the rapidly growing online shopping community is lack of a tool that is able to automatically compute the marginal benefit(MB) and the cost benefit (CB) analysis of purchasing product A from e-shop X; product B from e-shop Y, or product A and B all from e-shop X or e-shop Y.

This owes to the fact that both shops may have the same product, but the MB and CB are highly subjective to factors such as shipping costs which may differ from e-shop X to Y, consumer ratings for each products in the two stores, quality, price among others

BlueCart is an e-commerce website that focuses on providing solutions for marginal benefit and cost benefit. 
BlueCart Marketplace is built using React and Python (Flask)
